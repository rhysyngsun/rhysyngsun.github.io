In the past I've used Wordpress and then Posterous, but with obvious recent events that wasn't going to be good for the long term. I honestly only ever wrote a single "First Post" on posterous, because I didn't have any personal investment in the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had previously got sick of the maintenence around Wordpress (not to mention the PHP) and moved to Posterous for simplicity. I feel Jekyll/GHP balances my desire for simplicity with my need for control when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
