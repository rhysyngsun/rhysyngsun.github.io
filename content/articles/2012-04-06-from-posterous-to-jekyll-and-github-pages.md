Title: From Posterous to Jekyll and GitHub Pages
Date: 2012-04-06 15:33:00 -0400

This is my first time playing with building a Jekyll-based site for [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). In the past I've used Wordpress and then Posterous, but with obvious recent events that wasn't going to be good for the long term. I honestly only ever wrote a single "First Post" on posterous, because I didn't have any personal investment in the site.

I had previously got sick of the maintenence around Wordpress (not to mention the PHP) and moved to Posterous for simplicity. I feel Jekyll/GHP balances my desire for simplicity with my need for control when I need it.
