    <p>I've spent the last week looking at various CI solutions. My main criteria were:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a flexible <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html">Continuous Delivery</a> <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DeploymentPipeline.html">deployment pipeline</a></li>
<li>ability to promote builds to various environments (QA, prod, etc)</li>
<li>alerting to our team</li>
</ul>
<p>It started with an attempt at wrangling the defacto tool, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> into a usable system but that quickly proved to be an uphill battle.
Overly complication configuration aside, the final straw with Jenkins was being unable to configure
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-webhooks">GitHub Web Hooks</a>, however
that capability was dependent on having GitHub configured as <em>the</em> authentication method for users.</p>
<p>That's a pretty flawed design that speaks to a poor separation of concerns;
authentication strategy should not be tangled with an unrelated feature of the product.
Overall, I think the legacy of Jenkins' plugin architecture is weighing it (and its users) down.</p>
<p>I also took a look at numerous open source competitors to Jenkins as well as SaaS-based solutions.
Pretty much all of these fell short on Goal #2, which lead to me a conclusion that everyone out there either:</p>
<ul>
<li>is deploying code straight into production via automation (Continuous Deployment)</li>
<li>poured weeks of developer time into Jenkins</li>
<li>gave up on Jenkins and rolled a custom solution</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn't ready to commit to any of these at the immediate moment, so the situation was looking pretty bleak.
I <a href="https://twitter.com/rhysyngsun/status/461276722382790656">threw out a tweet</a> to vent my frustration at the state of CI/CD solutions.
<a href="https://twitter.com/twchad">Chad Wathington</a> replied that <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> had recently open sourced their Continuous Delivery solution <a href="https://github.com/gocd/gocd/">named Go</a> (not to be confused with Golang, an issue they're <a href="https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/128">acutely aware of</a>).</p>
<p>So far, I'm pretty impressed. As far as open source self-hostable CI solutions go, it's not nearing an complicated and limiting as Jenkins.
It does seem a <em>tad</em> more complicated than I need, but it's likely because my initial pass at getting a pipeline is intended to be a simple one.</p>
<p>I still feel like Go is needs a lot of work and hope to contribute to it myself at some point (although I wish it wasn't written in Java).</p>
<p>I've also got feeling that I should take a stab at my own solution (to be done on my own time, not my employer's).
There's a lot to still be done in this space and I have a gut feeling that it needs a fresh approach that incorporates all these learnings.
The fresh start is needed because an ideal solution for CI needs back pressure against complexity.</p>
